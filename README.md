# Classification_of_Artistic_Styles_Using_the_VGG_16_Convolutional_Neural_Network
This project uses a pre-trained VGG16 model and transfer learning to classify artworks by style (e.g., Impressionism, Cubism, Realism). With preprocessing and performance metrics like accuracy and F1-score, the model achieved high accuracy on the WikiArt dataset, showing promise for deep learning in art analysis.
